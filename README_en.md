## Introduction

This repository contains notes & self-study materials for UCB [CS 188 Spring 2024](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp24/); theoretically, all the materials you need to study this course can be found here and in the given external links.

- Notes: The main body is the original course notes[^1], with my own thoughts and typesetting added. You can read these notes on [my blog](https://darstib.github.io/blog/note/CS188/). However, for a better viewing experience, it is recommended to use Obsidian, see Usage-Reading.
- Self-study materials: Since some courses at UCB in recent years have started requiring [CalNet Authentication Service](https://auth.berkeley.edu/cas/login?service=https%3a%2f%2finst.eecs.berkeley.edu%2f%7ecs188%2fsp23%2f), to facilitate future learning, I have archived the materials I believe are necessary for self-study in [this repository](https://github.com/Darstib/cs188). As I am unsure how to apply for reprint permission, if [this project](https://github.com/Darstib/cs188) has a negative impact on the [original course](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp24/) and its related projects, please [contact me](https://darstib.github.io/blog/connect_me/) to delete it.
- If you are familiar with [search algorithms](https://oi-wiki.org/search/), have a good understanding of ML/DL/RL knowledge, and want to explore some small project files, you can directly work on the projects.

[^1]:  Firstly, I cannot guarantee the correctness of my translation; secondly, webpage/Obsidian reading can already be assisted by many plugins, you can refer to [Reading/Writing Articles](https://darstib.github.io/blog/collection/Tools/#i4); thirdly, my personal energy is limited, and I regret that I cannot fully create a CS188 full Chinese reading environment.

		- project 6 - Q7 code has been completed, but the training results are very poor, and there is nowhere to debug it, so I gave up.
